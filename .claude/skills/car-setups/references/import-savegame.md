# Workflow: import existing setups from a save file

Recover the setups the user already made in-game from their save file. Import is a **standalone
recovery feature**: it works **with or without a Notion connection**, and **whether or not the car
is onboarded**. When Notion is available the setups are appended to the `Setups` database (rows
with `Source = imported`); when it isn't, they're printed as a copy-pasteable table in chat.

**ACR-only.** The bundled parser reads ACR's UE5 GVAS save (`CarSetupsDataSaveSlot.sav`). Save-file
import is **not supported for other games** — don't attempt to parse a non-ACR save. For another
game, tell the user to onboard the car via screenshots (`onboard-car.md`) and build setups instead.

## Inputs
- An ACR save file, **attached in the chat** — `CarSetupsDataSaveSlot.sav` (on Windows it lives
  at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\acr\Saved\SaveGames\CarSetupsDataSaveSlot.sav`).
- **Car(s)** (usually inferable from the save) and **game** (`ACR`).
- A Notion connection is **optional** (see step 4).

## Procedure

### 1. Run the bundled parser
Run on the attached file via code execution: `python scripts/parse_acr_save.py <file> --pretty`
(human summary) or without `--pretty` for JSON. It returns
`{ok, setup_count, game_versions, save_format, nul_count, handler_used, notes, setups[]}`. Each
setup has `name, car, track, surface, game_version, drivetrain`
(FWD/RWD/AWD, from the diff sections), `warnings`, and `params: [{key, label, value}]` where `key`
is the raw game key (e.g. `Suspensions.Front.AdjusterRing`) with symmetric left/right already
collapsed, `(Key:Value)` wrappers stripped, and decimals tidied. The parser is **schema-agnostic** —
it captures *every* parameter, including ones it has no label for (those still come through with a
humanized `label`).

The parser is **version-aware**: it fingerprints the save format (`save_format`: GVAS engine /
custom versions), reads the per-setup game version(s) (`game_versions`), and dispatches to a
handler from a small registry (`handler_used`). Today there are two deterministic handlers —
`parse_structural` (strict reads; v0.4 and any same-format build) and `parse_nul_tolerant` (for
saves delivered without NUL terminators, seen on v0.2/v0.3 samples).

### 2. Branch on the result, and tell the user what happened
- **`ok: true`, `handler_used = parse_structural`** → continue to step 3.
- **`ok: true`, `handler_used = parse_nul_tolerant`** → continue, but **tell the user the save
  arrived without NUL terminators and was recovered** with the tolerant reader. Parameter values
  and multi-word names are recovered intact; however older saves don't always store a **surface**
  per setup, so a setup's `surface` may come back blank — ask the user to supply it in the approval
  step (it affects range resolution for onboarded cars). If they can re-export a clean save the
  strict path is tidier, but recovery is fine.
- **`ok: true` but a `game_versions` entry is outside the tested set** (the parser adds a
  `not in the tested set` note — e.g. a future `0.5.*`) → continue, but **flag that the version
  isn't explicitly validated** and ask the user to sanity-check the values before writing.
- **`ok: false`** (every Python handler found no setups / very few — the body format genuinely
  differs, e.g. a future build that re-serializes) → **fall back to AI extraction**. This is a hard
  rule: import never dead-ends just because Python parsing returned nothing. **Notify the user
  explicitly**: say the deterministic parser couldn't read the file (mention `handler_used` tried,
  the detected `save_format`/`game_versions`), that you're now reading the bytes directly yourself,
  and — when done — that this was an AI-assisted read to sanity-check. Read the bytes in code
  execution using the **Save format clues** below, reconstruct the same `setups[]` shape, and
  suggest the user share the save so a version-specific handler can be added to
  `scripts/parse_acr_save.py`. **Don't write anything you can't read confidently.**

### 3. Pick which setups to import
If the parsed setups span **more than one car, or more than one setup**, list them grouped by car
(name · track · surface · game version) and **ask the user whether to import all of them, only
specific cars, or only specific setups.** Carry only the selected subset through the rest of the
workflow. (A single setup → skip the prompt.) Show any `warnings` so the user can weigh them.

Then, for the selected subset, **show the full parsed values for approval** using the
**copy-pasteable convention** below — this is the user's confirmation before anything is written to
Notion (Rules: always get approval before writing), and it doubles as the final output for the
no-Notion path (step 7).

**Confirm-match fallback (un-matched car).** If a selected car matches **no** bundled template by the
import match rule (5.2: neither `save_ids` nor name) but a template **looks like the same car** by
name resemblance, don't silently fall to the raw path — **ask once, folded into this approval:**
> "The save calls this car `LanciaRally037Evo2`. The bundled **Lancia 037 Evoluzione 2 1984** template
> looks like the same car — onboard from it and import these setups onto its catalog? (Yes / No,
> import raw without ranges.)"

- **Yes** → treat it as a template match: auto-onboard from that template (5.2) and import onto the
  catalog. Also **offer to record the save string** in that template's `save_ids` so it auto-matches
  next time — point the user to `export-car-template.md`'s share flow (add `save_ids: ["{parser car}"]`
  to the template and contribute it back). Don't block the import on this.
- **No** (or no plausible template at all) → the **raw path** (5.2, third case): create value columns
  from the parsed keys, write as-is.

### Presenting setups in chat (copy-pasteable)
Whenever you print a setup's **parameter values** — for the approval step above, or as the
no-Notion output in step 7 — put them in a **fenced code block, one per car**. Never present
values as a rendered (pipe-syntax) markdown table outside a code block — those don't
select/copy cleanly. Inside each car's block:
- a header line: `{Car} — {distinct game version(s)}`;
- an aligned **monospace table**: first column = parameter label (parser's emitted order; you may
  add `[Section]` sub-headers from the key prefix for readability, per `share-setup.md`), then one
  column per selected setup of that car (column header = setup name, plus `· {surface}` when
  known); pad every column so values line up.
- **Tag each setup column with the treatment it will get** (step 5): `· official parse v{maj.min}`
  when the setup's game version **matches** the car's bundled-template `version` (run the
  *Version-match check* from step 5 — it only needs the template file's `version` and the parser's
  `game_version`, so it works here without Notion), otherwise `· as-is` (and `as-is (older)` when
  the version is simply lower). For `official parse` setups, note in one line that the stored
  values may be **snapped to the catalog's clean steps** in step 5 (the table here shows the raw
  parsed values); the exact stored values appear in the step 6 report.

List any parser `warnings` for that car **below** the block (outside the fences), not inside it.

### 4. Notion available, or chat-only?
Try to resolve the **`Car setups`** root via the Notion connector (per `notion-structure.md`).
- **Connector available** → continue to step 5 (write to Notion).
- **No Notion connection** (connector not configured / calls fail) → present a **choice**:
  1. **Set up Notion now** — walk the user through connecting Notion (claude.ai → Settings →
     Connectors → add Notion; see `README.md` setup steps) so their setups are saved and they get
     the full build/tweak/review experience. Once connected, continue to step 5; the structure is
     created on first write (`notion-structure.md` create-if-missing).
  2. **Just show them in chat** — skip Notion entirely and go to the **chat-table output**
     (step 7). Mention they can re-run the import later once Notion is set up.

### 5. Write to Notion — onboarding is optional
Read `notion-structure.md` before writing. **Order matters: per car, write the `Parameters` catalog
(onboarding) BEFORE writing any setups or computing any view's column order.** Snapping, value
validation, and column order all depend on the catalog — and the `Setups` value columns it creates —
already existing. Do these sub-steps **in this order**, per selected car:

> **No token needed for an all-template import.** When every selected car is auto-onboarded from a
> bundled template this run (the common fresh-workspace case), the whole write path is **token-free**:
> 5.4 maps/snaps against the template you already hold in context, and 5.6 orders columns with
> `--show-order --from-template` (no `Config` page, no REST). The read-only token is only required to
> read back a catalog for a car that was **already onboarded** before this run.

**5.1 — Ensure the base structure exists** (per `notion-structure.md`): the `Car setups` root →
`{Game}` page → the `Parameters`/`Setups` DBs → the `{Car}` page. Set the car page's
**`Drivetrain`** from the parser's `drivetrain` field (derived deterministically from the diff
sections) if not already set. **Don't create the Setups linked view yet** — that's step 5.3, after
the catalog exists.

**5.2 — Resolve/populate the `Parameters` catalog FIRST (onboarding).** This must finish before any
setup row is written. Pick the case:

- **Already onboarded (catalog present).** Load the car's Notion `Parameters` catalog **via
  [notion-rest-read.md](notion-rest-read.md)** (the connector can't list rows reliably) — the
  source of truth for column names and `Order`.

- **Not onboarded, but a bundled template matches this car → auto-onboard it now.** Look in
  `car-templates/` for a matching file using the **import match rule** (the parser's `car` is the raw
  in-save string, e.g. `MiniCooperS1275`, `LanciaRally037Evo2` — a compact ID that often won't fuzzy-
  match the template's human `car:` name, so check the alias first), in order:
    1. **`save_ids` exact match** — the parser's `car` equals any entry in a template's optional
       top-level `save_ids:` list (exact, after trimming whitespace). This is the reliable path.
    2. **else name match** — the parser's `car` matches a template's `car:` by the `onboard-car.md`
       step 1 rule (case-insensitive; ignore punctuation, hyphens, apostrophes). Note this **fails for
       many cars** whose save string drops the year or adds tokens (`Mini Cooper S 1964` ↔
       `MiniCooperS1275`; `Peugeot 306 II Maxi 1997` ↔ `Peugeot306IIMaxiKitCar`) — that's expected;
       rely on `save_ids` for those.
    3. **else no auto-match** → do **not** silently raw-path the car; run the **confirm-match
       fallback** in step 3 instead.

  If one matches (via 1 or 2), **auto-onboard from that template by running `onboard-car.md`'s
  bundled-template path**:
  write every template row into the `Parameters` catalog (with `Order` / `Discrete steps` /
  `Surface`) — **all rows in one `notion-create-pages` call**, and all the `Setups` value columns in
  **one `notion-update-data-source` call** (`SKILL.md` → *Batch Notion writes*) — and set the car's
  `Drivetrain` and identity facts (`Engine layout` / `Weight bias` / `Weight`) from the template.
  **Don't** show onboarding's interactive "Use this template? (Yes/No)" prompt — fold it into this
  import's approval (step 3): tell the user *"{Car} isn't onboarded yet but a bundled template
  exists — I'll onboard it from the template and import these N setups,"* and proceed on the same
  OK. If the parser's `drivetrain` disagrees with the template's, **prefer the template** (the
  curated catalog) and note the discrepancy. **Skip onboarding's optional gravel pass**
  (`onboard-car.md` step 8) — an import has no screenshots to compare; the template's rows already
  cover gravel where it ships `Surface` rows. After this the car **has a catalog** — treat it as the
  onboarded case from here on.

- **No catalog and no matching template → raw path (do not block).** There is **no** catalog. The
  `Setups` **value columns are created directly from the parsed keys** when the rows are written
  (5.5) — each param's humanized `label` as the column name, typed **Number** when the value is
  numeric and **Select** otherwise. Values are written **as-is, unvalidated** (no catalog to
  range-check against). In the report (step 6) state plainly that columns were created from the save
  and **ranges were not validated**, and **suggest onboarding** the car (screenshots or a bundled
  template, `onboard-car.md`) for the full build/tweak/review experience. Don't fabricate ranges or
  a `Parameters` catalog here — onboarding owns that. (Skip 5.4 for this path; values go in as-is.)

**5.3 — Ensure the `{Car}` page has its Setups view** (this is what makes imported rows show up on
the car page — without it the rows exist only in the main `Setups` table). Seed the page body the
**same way onboarding does** (`onboard-car.md` step 7, sub-steps 1–3): H2 "Setups" heading → the
`Setups[Car=this]` filtered linked view → H2 "Guidelines" stub. The linked view is **not** page
markdown — create it with `notion-create-view` per `notion-structure.md` → *Creating an inline
linked view*, which is **idempotent**: `notion-fetch` the page first; if a `Setups` linked view
already exists, re-assert it (don't append a duplicate); if it's missing, create it. The catalog now
exists (5.2), so the view's `SHOW` order is computable via the script; raw-path cars have no
catalog, so their view's order is asserted in 5.6 once the value columns exist. This applies to
**every** car you import into.

**5.4 — Map / snap / validate each setup's values against the catalog** (catalog cars only — the raw
path writes as-is). Match each parsed `key`/`label` to the catalog's `Adjustment` (the raw keys are
descriptive, e.g. `Suspensions.Front.AdjusterRing` → "Adjuster ring" in section "Suspensions —
Front"). **Flag any key you can't confidently map** rather than dropping it. **Resolve each value's
surface row:** map the parsed `surface` to the catalog's `Tarmac`/`Gravel`/`Snow` (asphalt → Tarmac;
dirt/mud → Gravel; ice → Snow; anything else → baseline), then use the surface-specific row if the
parameter has one; for `Snow`, fall back to a `Gravel` row before the baseline (see
[notion-rest-read.md](notion-rest-read.md)).

Then **choose each setup's value treatment by its game version — decide this _per setup_** (one save
can hold setups from several versions):

  1. **Version-match check.** Look in `car-templates/` for this car's bundled template (**same
     match rule as 5.2**). The setup is a **version match** only when **all** of these are true: a
     template exists, its `version` is **not** `"unknown"`, and the setup's parser `game_version`
     reduced to its **major.minor** family (first two dotted parts — e.g. `0.4.1.123` → `0.4`)
     **equals** that template `version` (e.g. `0.4`). Otherwise it is **not** a match.

  2. **If it matches → official-parse this setup (validate + snap to the catalog).** The save and
     catalog are the same game version, so store **clean, catalog-conformant values**:
     - When the resolved row has **`Discrete steps`**, store the **matching step** (snap the raw
       value to it) — but only when the raw value is **unambiguously** that step: an exact match
       after tidying decimals, or within a tiny tolerance for float noise (e.g. `0.087000` → the
       `0.087` step). For **named/paired** selections (tyre type, brake pads, LSD power/coast ramp,
       differential ratios) store the **canonical catalog option** the raw value maps to.
     - For **continuous** `Min..Max` params (no `Discrete steps`) there is no grid — keep the value
       exact.
     - **Validate** against the resolved row. Because the versions match, a value outside `Min..Max`
       (or a discrete value matching **no** step — not just float noise) is a **genuine anomaly** —
       **flag it clearly** (e.g. *"Rear ARB 9 is outside the catalog 1–8 at the matching version
       0.4 — please check"*) but **still write it** (never clamp or drop). Do **not** use the soft
       "older version" note here — at a matching version it isn't an older-version difference.

  3. **If it does NOT match** (older save, no template, or template `version` is `"unknown"`) **→
     as-is (the unchanged v0.6.0 path).** Write every value **exactly as the save had it — never
     clamp or drop**. When a value falls outside its resolved row's `Min..Max` (or isn't in its
     `Discrete steps` when filled), don't flag it one-by-one; instead **collect them all into one
     short, non-blocking note** for the report (step 6), framed as a likely version difference —
     e.g. *"2 values are outside the current catalog range, written as-is (likely an older game
     version): Spring Stiffness Front 41000 (catalog 42300–73100); Rear ARB 9 (catalog 1–8)."*
     (Informational, not something the user must fix.)

  In **both** treatments: keep the **key-mapping flag** above, and write **`TyreType` values
  fully-qualified** (e.g. `Tarmac Snow`, `Snow (Studs)`) — if the save or catalog holds an ambiguous
  legacy name (bare `Snow`, `Gravel`, `Dry Tarmac`), map it to its canonical ACR name before
  writing; if it can't be disambiguated confidently, flag it for the user instead of guessing.

**5.5 — Write the `Setups` rows — all in one `notion-create-pages` call** (≤100; `SKILL.md` →
*Batch Notion writes*), one page per setup. Parsed names come from the in-game field and are already
**≤15 chars**; if one somehow exceeds it, compact it before writing (per `SKILL.md` core rules).
Each row:
- `Name`, `Car`, `Surface`, `Game version`, `Date`, `Source = imported`. Write `Car` as the
  **exact same `Car` Select value** the car page's linked view filters on (`FILTER "Car" =
  "{Car}"`), via create-or-reuse — a casing or spacing mismatch would make the rows vanish from the
  per-car view even though they're in the table;
- `Location`/`Stage` if a `track` maps to one in the `Locations` catalogue, else leave both blank —
  **never fabricate a stage facts page** from an import;
- **`Skill version`** (per `SKILL.md` → *Skill version* — written for imported rows too, since it
  identifies the import logic that produced the row, unlike `Model` which stays blank here);
- **`Learn from this` = unchecked** (imported setups carry raw numbers without driving-intent
  context — the user checks it after deciding a setup is worth learning from);
- plus the mapped (catalog) or raw value properties.

Record each value **per its treatment in 5.4**: **snapped to the catalog** for official-parse
(version-matched) setups, **as-is** for the rest (older version / no template / `unknown` / raw
path). **Never modify or delete existing rows.**

**5.6 — Apply the column order — MANDATORY, never skip (even on a quick / low-effort run); the
import is not done until you've done it.** After the rows (and their value columns) exist, apply the
column order (`notion-structure.md` → *Applying the order*) — set `SHOW` on the main `Setups` table
view and the car's linked view:
- **Auto-onboarded from a bundled template this run** → get the `SHOW` list from the script's
  **token-free** mode — `… --show-order --from-template car-templates/{car}.yaml` for the car view,
  and one `--from-template` per imported car for the main table (`notion-structure.md` → *Applying the
  order* → token-free path). You already hold every `Order` locally, so **no token / `Config` page /
  REST is needed**. Use the output verbatim.
- **Already onboarded before this run** (catalog read from Notion in 5.2) → get the `SHOW` list from
  the script's **token** mode (`… "{Car}" --show-order` for the car view, `… --all --show-order` for
  the main table) and use it verbatim.
- **Raw-columns car** (no catalog, so the script has no `Order` to read) → build `SHOW` by hand
  instead: `Name`, then the raw value columns **in the parser's emitted order**, then the meta
  columns.

This step **re-asserts `SHOW` on views that already exist** (an idempotent view update, not a
rebuild), so the car's linked Setups view must have been created in 5.3 — applying the order does
**not** create a missing view. A newly created view is alphabetical until this `SHOW` is asserted,
so don't skip it.

### 6. Report (Notion path)
Cover, in order:
- which handler/version was used (or that the AI fallback was used);
- the setups imported and which car each landed under;
- for any car you **auto-onboarded from a bundled template**, say so (the catalog/columns came
  from the template, not screenshots);
- which setups were **officially parsed** (game version matched the car's template version — values
  validated and **snapped to the catalog**) vs imported **as-is** (version differed / no template /
  `unknown`); name the matched version (e.g. *"3 setups official-parsed against the v0.4 template"*);
- any **un-mappable keys** you couldn't confidently match to a column (these are still flagged for
  the user);
- **same-version anomalies** — for official-parse setups, any value that still fell **outside** the
  catalog at the matching version — listed separately as real *"please check"* items (these are
  genuine, not an older-version difference);
- **out-of-range values from as-is setups as a single informational note** — *"written as-is,
  likely an older game version"* (the v0.6.0 path). This is **not** a warning and **not** something
  the user must fix;
- for an **un-onboarded car with no template** (raw-columns path), that its columns were created
  raw/unvalidated, with the suggestion to onboard it (screenshots or a template) for the full
  build/tweak/review experience;
- **confirm in one line that you asserted the column order** on the affected views (step 5) — if you
  can't, you skipped a required step: go back and do it before finishing.

Remind the user that imported setups start **unrated** and **unchecked** — they can **rate each
`1`–`5`** and tick `Learn from this` once they've vetted it.

### 7. Chat-table output (no-Notion path)
Present the selected setups using the **copy-pasteable convention** above (one fenced code block
per car). Remind the user these are **raw in-game values** (not range-validated, no reasoning
attached), and that connecting Notion later lets them save, build, tweak, and review setups. Do
**not** write anything to Notion in this path.

## Save format clues (for the AI fallback)
- The file is an **Unreal Engine 5 GVAS** save (`/Script/dmengine.SaveGameSlot` ·
  `CarSetupsSaveGameData`). After the GVAS header it uses a custom body.
- Strings are **FString**: `int32 length` + that many bytes + a trailing `NUL` (length is
  negative for UTF-16). **Don't** read the file as text with NUL→space substitution — that
  corrupts length prefixes. (If a file *arrives* already NUL-stripped — `nul_count == 0`, every
  `0x00` is `0x20` — the deterministic `parse_nul_tolerant` handler already covers it; you only
  reach this AI fallback when **both** handlers fail.)
- Setups are stored as a sequence of `key → value` **string pairs**, e.g.
  `Suspensions.FrontLeft.AdjusterRing` → `0.087000`, `Differentials.Rear.LSDRamps` →
  `(LSDRampAngles:60_70)`. Keys are dotted identifiers; values are either numeric strings or
  `(Type:Value)` wrappers. Collapse symmetric `FrontLeft`/`FrontRight` & `RearLeft`/`RearRight`
  → Front/Rear (they should match). Per-setup metadata strings (name, version, car, track,
  surface) appear just before each block of pairs.

## Rules
- Append-only; never overwrite existing setups.
- Always get user approval of the parsed output before writing.
- Import works **without Notion** (chat table) and **without onboarding** (raw columns) — never
  block recovery on either.
- **Every car imported into Notion gets a `{Car}` page with a `Setups` linked view** — without it
  the rows don't show on the car page (create-if-missing, re-assert-if-present; step 5).
- **If the car isn't onboarded but a bundled template matches it, auto-onboard from the template
  first** (step 5), then import onto that catalog.
- **Decide each setup's value treatment by its game version (step 5), per setup.** When the setup's
  game version **matches** the car's bundled-template `version` (major.minor) → **official-parse**:
  validate and **snap** values to the catalog. Otherwise → **as-is**: write values exactly as the
  save had them and report out-of-range values as a single informational note (likely an older game
  version), never an error.
- **Never clamp or drop a value** in either treatment. As-is writes raw; official-parse snaps only
  unambiguous discrete values and **flags** (doesn't force) genuine same-version out-of-range
  anomalies.
- When Python parsing returns 0 setups, **always** fall back to AI extraction and tell the user.
